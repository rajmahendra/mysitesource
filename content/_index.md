Hello! :pray:

Welcome to my Blog. 

Everyone have two dimentions, Family and Career for me I have explored third dimension, that is Community! Leaving my personal dimenstion after from my own carrier, I have spent time on Opensource and helping developer to create a platform to learn, share and contributeto Global community of Java related Technology. 

The content in my blog mostly on Java related technology, light weight process tools,  Community Building, and some of my passion in Sustainable living, Fermented food, Gardening, Veganism and my personal rationalistic views. 

**Technology**

 I am a software craftsman, I code and same time I share my toys. This blog will give some of my learning in Java related technologies like  Java, Kotling, Gradle, Jakarta EE., etc. 

 **Agility**

 Apart from Java, I am a Agilist. I love to help Teams to be high performance team. Yes to be high performance is not a skill but a long term habbit change. It all comes from sustainable journey towards that. You learn in this blog on some of my views of my personal journy. 

 **Sustainable Living**

 What ever you do in yoru life for living if your have to live with nature, it will destroy you. This is what we see today in the world of climatic change, green house gas etc. Everthing starts from our home the place where we live!. Our life is dependent on this planet, The Earth. We cant live like Elvs but as a _Wice_ Human (Homo sapiens) we can live with the nateru to sow what we reap.
